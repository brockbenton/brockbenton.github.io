I am grateful to have been selected as a recipient of the <a href="https://boettcherfoundation.org/scholarships/">Boettcher Scholarship</a>, a prestigious full-ride award granted each year to 50 Colorado high school seniors who demonstrate exceptional academic achievement, intellectual curiosity, leadership, community and school involvement, and strong character.
