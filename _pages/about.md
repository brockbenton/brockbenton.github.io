I am an honors Computer Science and Economics student at the University of Colorado Boulder. Within the Computer Science department, I am the Head of Academics for the CS Undergraduate Advising Committee (CSUAC) where I ___. Additionally, I am apart of the Blockchain club and participate in intramural sports. 

I am currently exploring topics at the intersection of theory and systems. I have particularly enjoyed learning about blockchain technologies, Linux-based development, and algorithmic economics, and I an interested in how formal models and real-world infrastructure can inform each other.

Outside of school, I run my own clothing store via Depop (and sometimes eBay) which you can check out <a href="https://depop.com/imbrock">@imbrock</a>.
